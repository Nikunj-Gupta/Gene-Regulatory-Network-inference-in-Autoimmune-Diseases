Sixteen pairs of oligonucleotide probes are used to measure the level of transcription of each sequence represented on the GeneChip® Vitis vinifera (Grape) Genome Array. Sequences used in the design of the V. vinifera Genome Array were selected from GenBank®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 7, Oct 2003)., , Annotations derived from Affymetrix CSV file dated 6/23/2004\n",
